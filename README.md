The application allows the user to input a city, the dashboard will then display the current weather for that city, and a following 5 day forecast for it as well. After the user inputs a city, it is saved into a search history, in which each searched city can be clicked on again to perform the current weather and 5 day forecast for whichever city you have clicked on.
